# RC Tracker

RC Tracker is a simple and customizable app for RC (Radio-Controlled) hobby enthusiasts to organize their equipment and setups. 
It allows users to create folders for parts, tools, tires, and setups, and even supports nested folders for detailed organization.

## Features

- **Nested Folders**: Create subfolders endlessly for deeper categorization.

## Future Features (Planned)

- Introduce login/signup for syncing data across devices.
- AI-powered setup assistant to suggest changes based on track performance.
